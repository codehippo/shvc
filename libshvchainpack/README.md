Files in this library are fork of chainpack implementation in
[libshv](https://github.com/silicon-heaven/libshv/tree/master/libshvchainpack/c).
They were forked primarily to provide documentation in headers. It should be
possible to copy over source files but you need to merge header changes.

The libshv commit of latest merge: 6ea68d7b37b633e0cc574af706a5477b5dca0f37
